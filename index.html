    <h2>Read our Starter Guide</h2>
    <p class="desc">To get started, first of all go and open 'Create a file' in the menu options. Then there will come across you a form asking you for your name, your secret code, your title of the file, and the content of the file, and perhaps a submit button. Enter your name as is, but make sure no symbols like hash, exclamation, dollar, percentage, exponentiation, and asterisk or any brackets are included in your name. Only numbers and alphabets are allowed. That means only alphanumeric characters are allowed to enter as your name. Then the form will ask you for your code. Just like your name, the code should not involve or contain any symbol as it might affect the location of the form. Make sure to note this thing. And also make sure to keep your name and your code saved at some place as losing it might affect in locating your files. Make sure to use the same name and password in the same case as they are case sensitive in File Encryptor. Then the form will ask you for your title of your file. Make sure that the title is alphanumeric and can contain whitespaces also. Your title should be similar to your content of the file as later on while locating them it might be a problem for you to remember the names of your file. Then write the content of your file easily and then hit the submit button and then you will be redirected to a new page. There you will see a new file made only for you!!</p>
